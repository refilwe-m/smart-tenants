# Smart Tenants

A place for building owners and tenants to have total control of their electricity usage.
With Smart Tenants you will get to control your electricity usage with an interactive web app. Track meter reading, electronics usage, average monthly usage, and get tips to save electricity.

This will allow transparency between building owners and their tenants.

## What Inspired Smart Tenants?

The project was inspired by the challenges we faced when starting to rent apartments. If you've ever encountered these problems, you are the inspiration for **SmartTenants**:

- Ever received a bill and had no idea why your electricity cost was so high?
- Struggled to track high electricity consumption in your building and couldn't identify which units were responsible?
- Bought electricity only to run out before your next purchase?
- Experienced varying monthly electricity prices?
  
## What does SmartTenants do?

**SmartTenants** allows tenants to easily track their meter readings, identify high-consumption electronics, and provide building owners with transparent and actionable data on tenant electricity usage.

It solves communication gaps between tenants and building owners regarding electricity consumption and billing, which often leads to misunderstandings and disputes.

It gives building owners with visibility/transparency into the electricity usage patterns of their tenants, which makes it difficult to identify high consumption units and promote energy-saving initiatives.

Allows tenants to make informed decisions to reduce their energy usage as there will be clear insights into which electronics consume the most electricity.

Gives both the tenants and owner peace of mind about each and every single digit that is on the bill.
